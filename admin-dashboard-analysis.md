  - Life area preferences and engagement
  - Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
  - Geographic distribution of users

## 4. Current Monitoring & Logging
- **Existing Logging**: 
  - Python logging framework with detailed repository operations
  - Debug logging for CRUD operations in `generic_repository.py`

  - Function execution logging
- **Analytics/Monitoring Integrations**: 
  - Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry (commented out but available)
  - Native Azure Functions monitoring
  - Cosmos DB metrics and diagnostics
- **Application Insights**: 
  - Available but not currently enabled (`azure-monitor-opentelemetry` commented in requirements.txt)
  - Function App has built-in Application Insights integration
- **Custom Telemetry**: 
  - Detailed logging in repository operations
  - CORS origin tracking
  - User ID tracking across all operations
  - Document type and operation tracking

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Health Indicators**: 
  - Function availability and uptime
  - Health endpoint response time (<200ms target)
  - Cosmos DB connection success rate
  - Error rate per endpoint (<1% target)
- **Scaling Metrics**: 
  - Concurrent function executions
  - Queue depth for async operations
  - Cosmos DB throughput utilization
  - Function memory consumption
- **User Behavior Insights**: 
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly active users
  - Feature utilization rates (tasks 80%, goals 60%, habits 40%, projects 30%)
  - Session duration and frequency
  - Onboarding completion rate (target >70%)
  - User lifecycle stage distribution
- **Operational Metrics**: 
  - API call volume per endpoint
  - Average response time per operation type
  - Preview code validation success rate
  - CORS preflight request patterns

## 6. Integration Points
- **Service Interactions**: 
  - Frontend to Backend API calls
  - Repository pattern with Cosmos DB containers
  - Generic repository handling multiple document types
  - User profile repository for authentication context
- **External APIs/Dependencies**: 
  - Azure Cosmos DB SQL API
  - Azure Functions runtime
  - Azure Static Web Apps (for CORS allowlist)
  - Potential future integrations (calendar, notifications)
- **Data Flows**: 
  - User → Frontend → Azure Functions → Cosmos DB → Response
  - Preview code validation flow
  - Cross-document relationships (tasks to projects, goals to tasks)
  - Life area categorization across all entities
- **Cross-Service Correlations**: 
  - User ID correlation across all operations
  - Document relationships (project_id, goal_id references)
  - Life area analytics across different entity types
  - Temporal correlations (creation, update, completion patterns)

## 7. Future Considerations
- **Planned Features**: 
  - Proper authentication and authorization system
  - Real-time notifications and reminders
  - Analytics dashboard for user insights
  - Mobile app API extensions
  - Integration with calendar systems
  - Habit streak gamification
  - Goal progress visualization
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Anonymous authentication poses security risks
  - Cross-partition queries may impact performance at scale
  - Manual CORS origin management
  - No rate limiting or throttling
  - Limited error tracking and alerting
  - No user data backup/export functionality
- **User Behavior Questions**: 
  - Which life areas drive the most engagement?
  - What's the optimal onboarding flow length?
  - How do users interact with different goal timeframes?
  - What causes users to abandon habit tracking?
  - Which features correlate with long-term retention?
- **Operational Challenges**: 
  - Monitoring serverless function cold starts
  - Managing Cosmos DB costs with growing data
  - Ensuring data consistency across document types
  - Scaling preview code management
  - Implementing proper logging without performance impact
  - Managing deployment rollbacks in serverless environment

## 8. Technical Implementation Details
- **Repository Files**: 
  - `generic_repository.py` - Generic CRUD operations for all document types
  - `user_profile_repository.py` - User-specific operations and onboarding
  - `preview_code_repository.py` - Preview code validation system
  - `task_repository.py` - Legacy task-specific operations
- **Data Models**:
